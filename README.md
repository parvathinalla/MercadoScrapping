## Project Description

This Python script is designed to scrape product information from MercadoLibre's Argentina website. It efficiently handles pagination, dynamically fetches and parses HTML pages using XPath queries, and extracts detailed product data such as product name, price, availability, image URLs, descriptions, ratings, review counts, and categories. 

The script leverages widely-used libraries such as `requests`, `lxml`, `PyYAML`, and built-in Python utilities to ensure robust and reliable web scraping. It includes error handling, mimics browser requests by setting realistic HTTP headers, and provides a structured output in JSON format. The script is straightforward to configure and extend, making it ideal for scraping various product categories or adapting to similar e-commerce platforms.
